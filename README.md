### Project Title:
My First Website
### The purpose of this website:
This website was created as a way to display my progressive knowledge on the skills we are learning about in class. I am doing so by showcasing my use of communication and accountability through this project. This becomes really important when welcoming teamwork because it allows for communication a fundamental peace of teamwork and projects. It is important to express these fundamentals because it can lead to success. It is often that success is desired, especially when working as a team but this cannot be accomplished without lots of communication. Communicating enforces the overall desired outcome and creates checkpoints along the way which in turn strengthens a project. This is why showcasing this project is important.
