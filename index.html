            <h3>My Goals</h3>
            <p>
                    I have many goals for my career. Sometimes I feel a lot of pressure because I started at a young age. 
                Starting with this course, I would really love to get an A. I struggled a lot through my past classes due 
                to the major I was attempting, which was nursing. Though I might not have picked this class, I want to get 
                an A in order to boost my GPA. I want to be proud of annoucing it. This might be the competitive in me but 
                to me it symbolizes my dedication to doing my absolute best at something. In this case it would be my attempt 
                to get an A in this class. Like I mentioned, it wasn't an enthusiastic decision taking this course but I am 
                happy I chose to do so because I found myself enjoying it and cannot wait to learn more. 
            </p>
            <p>
                    Though figuring out what my career will look like in the future is hard right now, I believe choosing
                Digital Media and Professional Communications will allow me to have more opportunities on my life's 
                course of action. I am currently in the Air Force, and although this job has given me amazing opportunities and 
                made sacrifices worthwhile, it is not what I expected and not my cup of tea. I want to have the choice to 
                stay in if I choose, or pursue a civilian career with more flexibility. I want to be able to make decisions 
                that keep me excited about my career and maintain balance for the rest of my life. I want, like most, to be able 
                to explore and enjoy quality time with family and friends because the military has made this harder to do.
